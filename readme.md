
**Docker Multi-Stage Pipeline**

Overview
This project leverages Docker Multi-Stage builds and GitHub Actions to automate the daily build and deployment of our website code. The pipeline runs scheduled tasks every day during non-business hours, ensuring the application remains up-to-date without impacting production operations. The latest Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub for easy distribution and deployment.
